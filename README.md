# FlopShout

Our initial goal for this game was to make a game that was voice controlled. The very idea of that seemed very much fun as it would not only help the people who may not be able to play the game otherwise but would also be fun to play around in a party setting with your friends. We decided that the best and the most fun game for that would be Floppy Bir but with a twist of being voice controlled! Once we have decided to do that we also thought that it would be good for us to have some design experience and to make this game even more our own the we chose to create the art work ourselves. Everything (apart from the background) was made by us in various programs like Photoshop C7 and etc. We were extremely excited we started coding right away, but then we encountered some issues, some code didn't work as we thought it would and eclipse was difficult for us to deal with but we did our best anyway. I hope that you enjoy this game as much as we enojyed making it!
